## Quick Start

### Before the Jam

1. **Setup GitHub Issue Templates**
   - Choose your language and follow the [GitHub Templates Guide](./Docs/Github-Issues/README.md)
   - Create labels and configure your repository
   - Set up GitHub Projects (Kanban board)

2. **Choose your language** and open the corresponding guidelines
3. **Read Section 1** (Team Operations) before the jam starts

### During the Jam

4. **Use Section 3** (GDD Template) during the kickoff meeting
5. **Follow Section 4** (Action Plan) during the jam
6. **Use GitHub Issue Templates** for all tasks and bugs
7. **Reference Section 5** (Resources) as needed

## Golden Rule

> **Done is Better than Perfect**
>
> In a game jam, a functional and simple game always beats an ambitious unfinished project.

## Key Milestones

- **Day 1**: First Playable (movement + enemy + basic level)
- **Day 2**: Feature Complete
- **Last 6 hours**: Polish Only
- **3 hours before deadline**: CODE FREEZE

## Team Roles

This documentation supports four core roles:

- **Game Designer**: Defines concept, mechanics, and level design
- **Programmer**: Implements gameplay systems and integration
- **3D Modeler**: Creates visual assets and environment
- **Animator**: Rigs characters and creates animations

## Technology Stack

- **Game Engine**: Unity 6
- **3D Modeling**: Blender
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
- **Project Management**: Notion
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Issues
